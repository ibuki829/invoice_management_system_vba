# Delivery Note & Invoice Issuance System (Microsoft Access)

A Microsoft Access-based Delivery Note and Invoice issuance system designed for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs).
It features input efficiency (autocomplete) and historical data preservation (denormalization), optimized for printing on B5 paper.

## 📋 Features

* **Input Assistance**: Displays candidates by simply typing the "reading" of customer or product names, and auto-completes addresses and unit prices.
* **Historical Data Preservation**: Designed to preserve past slip data (information at the time of issuance) even if master data (addresses or prices) changes in the future.
* **B5 Printing Support**: Optimized for B5 paper (vertical), sequentially outputting a Delivery Note followed by an Invoice.

## 🛠 Tech Stack / Environment

* **Platform**: Microsoft Access (Office 365 / 2019 or later recommended)
* **Language**: VBA (minimal event control), Access Macro
* **File Format**: `.accdb`

## 💾 Database Structure (Schema & ER Diagram)

This system follows a typical "Header-Detail" relational database structure but includes **intentionally denormalized fields** to preserve historical data integrity.
